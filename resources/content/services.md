## New Homes for Private Clients ##

We have designed luxury oceanfront residences, homes on the on the intracoastal and deep water canals and golf courses. Our portfolio includes private homes in the country and homes on small city lots, designed to maximize efficiency. But we never forget that the most important home to you is your home.

## Additions to Existing Homes ##

There is great value in buying an older home and updating it, not only as an investment, but also in terms of customizing the house for the way you live.  A growing family might need an additional bathroom, or new bedrooms.  A new entry feature or exterior facelift on an older house instantly adds value and curb appeal. Or add the feature you’ve always wanted, whether it’s a gym, an art studio or a new garage.

## Remodels of Existing Homes and Condominiums ##

Sometimes your best real estate option is the home you already own, with a few improvements.  A modern, open kitchen makes entertaining and family gatherings easier and fun. Empty nesters suddenly have enough space for their dream master suite.  A remodel can provide a new centerpiece for your residence and increase the comfort and enjoyment you get from your home.
