Steven Epstein graduated from the University of Miami in 1981 and became a registered architect in 1984.

After working for local and nationally known architectural and interior design firms, he formed Steven Z Epstein Architects in 1987. The only computer in the office was used for correspondence and bookkeeping. A lot has changed since then as we moved to a larger office, utilized state of the art computers and software, and plot and print our drawings in-house.

# Building Connections.

Our motto is “Building Connections”, because we have found that our clients recommend us to their friends, families and business associates.  In fact, most of our advertising is word of mouth.  “Building Connections”also reflects our ability to collaborate with clients on a variety of projects, creating not only solid design but relationships along the way.  Bring us your ideas and we will take your project from concept to reality, respecting your style and budget. SZE clients range from small contractors to growing families to national chains, and hopefully you.
